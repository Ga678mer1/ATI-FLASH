AMD/ATI Pixel Clock Patcher modifies the AMD/ATI video driver to allow higher resolutions and refresh rates by removing the 165 MHz pixel clock limit for single-link DVI and HDMI, the 330 MHz limit for dual-link DVI, and the 400 MHz limit for VGA.

## Requirements:
+ Windows Vista or later
+ 5000-series GPU or newer
+ CrossFire: R9 280/280X and older cards require two CrossFire bridges if the pixel clock is greater than 300 MHz. This is only possible with cards that have two connectors. It will not work properly with more than two cards. Dual-GPU cards such as the 7990 will not work properly at higher pixel clocks.

## Compatibility:
+ Version 1.4.14 is compatible with Catalyst 11.9 to Adrenalin 22.10.1. It can be used with future versions if it finds the limits you need.
+ Riot Vanguard and FACEIT Anti-Cheat will not allow patched drivers to load.

## Getting started:
1. Run atikmdag-patcher.exe. (If you only need the BIOS signature patch, rename it to atikmdag-patcher-bios.exe first.)
2. If all limits are found, click "Yes" to patch and sign. If a limit is not found or if multiple matches are found, the patcher needs to be updated.
3. Reboot.

You can then add higher refresh rates using [Custom Resolution Utility (CRU)](https://www.monitortests.com/forum/Thread-Custom-Resolution-Utility-CRU).

To restore the unpatched driver, run the patcher again and click "Yes" to restore from backup.

Unpatching is not required before upgrading drivers. Simply run the patcher again after installing the new driver.

## Options:
+ You can rename the .exe file to change certain options:
+ atikmdag-patcher-bios.exe - Patch BIOS signature check only.
+ atikmdag-patcher-sl.exe - Make dual-link DVI ports act as single-link DVI. Use this to go beyond 230 MHz pixel clock with single-link DVI monitors.
+ atikmdag-patcher-dl.exe - Do not patch single-link DVI limit on dual-link DVI ports. Useful for 2560x1080 monitors.
+ atikmdag-patcher-self.exe - Use self-signed certificate. Windows test mode is required: https://www.monitortests.com/testmode.zip

## Known issues:

Legacy drivers may have issues with HDCP and video acceleration with the patch. Workarounds for video playback issues:
+ Disable hardware acceleration in the Flash Player settings (right-click on any Flash video and click "Settings...").
+ Use the Codec Tweak Tool to disable DXVA hardware acceleration under "Various Tweaks" (in the "Miscellaneous" section).

Older cards require the "LCD standard" vertical blanking/total to reduce the memory clock when idle. Horizontal values can still be reduced if necessary. Newer cards can handle some lower values depending on the resolution and refresh rate.

Older cards have a design limitation unrelated to the patch that causes video acceleration to scramble the screen if the vertical blanking/total is below standard with the video card's memory overclocked or with multiple monitors connected. Skype is known to trigger this problem. Either don't overclock the video card's memory, or use the "LCD standard" vertical blanking/total in CRU.
